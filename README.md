## 📖 Overview
**Task 6** completes the internship technical track by introducing **Regression**. We predicted California housing prices based on census data.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1.  **Data Loading:** Loaded `california_housing` dataset.
2.  **Split:** Divided data into Training (80%) and Testing (20%) sets.
3.  **Modeling:** Implemented **Linear Regression**.
4.  **Evaluation:** Used **MAE** and **RMSE** to measure prediction accuracy.
5.  **Visualization:** Plotted Feature Coefficients to understand *why* the model made its predictions.

## 📊 Key Insights
* **Primary Driver:** Median Income (`MedInc`) is by far the strongest predictor of house value.
* **Model Accuracy:** The model predicts prices with an average error (MAE) of roughly **$53,000**.
